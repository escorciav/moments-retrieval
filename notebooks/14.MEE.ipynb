    "We use the text-to-video retrieval algorithm in cascade with a text-to-moment retrievla algorithm to search for moments inside a video corpus. This is effectively corresponds to a two-stage retrieval approach. In the first stage, we search for potential videos associated with a given query. In the second stage, we apply a moment retrieval algorithm over the candidate videos retrieved by the first stage.\n",
