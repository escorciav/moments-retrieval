Welcome to @escorcia garage!!!

Research projects are highly non-linear, thus designing code in advance becomes too much overhead for a single person. Moreover, dealing with data just adds more fire to the non-trivial amount of under specification in research. Based on this, I ended up setting a middle point, the garage, where I just prototype, debug and play while it's less fuzzy how to solve the problem.

Sometimes, cells takes a lot of time that I prefer to move them onto "/scripts" an let them running on clusters. In general, the code here requires refactoring, but at least you might find comments and figures to guide you üòÖ.


__Notes__:

- Some notebooks may not run and that's fine, right?

    If I take your notes I may have a hard time navigating through them üòÅ. Going back to the topic, as long as you have the correct development environment, errors are trivial to fix. At least those related to missing funtions or modules, just append the project folder into the PYTHONPATH.

    The trick is similar to the following lines:

    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.append('..')
    ```

    I trust that you want it so badly to find the relevant snippets to ease your work.
